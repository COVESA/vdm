  Requested mode of wiper system. STOP_HOLD means that the wipers shall move to position given by TargetPosition and then hold the position. WIPE means that wipers shall move to the position given by TargetPosition and then hold the position if no new TargetPosition is requested. PLANT_MODE means that wiping is disabled. Exact behavior is vehicle specific. EMERGENCY_STOP means that wiping shall be immediately stopped without holding the position.

  """
  Requested position of main wiper blade for the wiper system relative to reference position. Location of reference position (0 degrees) and direction of positive/negative degrees is vehicle specific. System behavior when receiving TargetPosition depends on Mode and IsEndingWipeCycle. Supported values are vehicle specific and might be dynamically corrected. If IsEndingWipeCycle=True then wipers will complete current movement before actuating new TargetPosition. If IsEndingWipeCycle=False then wipers will directly change destination if the TargetPosition is changed.
